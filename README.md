# mandj application with express and mongodb
# This app was made for my beloved sister, Zuleima, and my brother-in-law, Juan. As their wedding date approaches, I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to create a website for their wedding to share with their guests. There is plenty more things I wish to include to make it fully-functioning and presentable. For starters I need to fix the new-user form and the radio buttons don't work when either submitting a new or updated request. 

# In your terminal make sure to run the following commands:
# cd crud_app -> npm init -y -> npm i express morgan nodemon ejs body-parser dotenv mongoose axios

# Enjoy!
